Requirements: Go binary needs to be in your $PATH, and $GOPATH needs to be setup.

To install goimport so you can use it anywhere
```
chmod +x goimport.py
cp goimport.py /usr/local/bin/goimport
```

cd into a Go package directory that you want to install.

```
cd ~/Desktop/oauth1
goimport

That is it.
